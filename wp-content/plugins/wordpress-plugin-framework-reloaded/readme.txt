Allows other plugins to use Wordpress Plugin Framework Reloaded. Made for plugin developers.

== Description ==

First of all, this is a plugin made for plugin developers. User have to install it <b>ONLY</b> if someone's plugin requires it. Said that we must issue a disclaimer about Wordpress Plugin Framework Reloaded.

= IF YOU ARE NOT A PLUGIN DEVELOPER =

* Go to [Installation](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-plugin-framework-reloaded/installation/) now and skip the rest.


= IF YOU ARE A PLUGIN DEVELOPER = 

<b>WARNING! IN PURE ALPHA! IT WORKS BUT EXPECT SUDDEN MODIFICATIONS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR PLUGINS.</b>


Wordpress Plugin Framework Reloaded was based on previous work and ideias from Aaron Campbell, Mark Waterous, Husterk, Leonardo Martinez, Joost De Valk, Ozh and so many other Wordpress developers. Thanks to you all.

The Wordpress Plugin Framework Reloaded is available and you can install it (in fact, <b>you should if another plugin requires it</b>). Neverthless, for the time being <b>WE DO NOT OFFER ANY SUPPORT</b> to developers wishing to use it. But, <b>remember</b>, it is supplied AS IS and with NO WARRANTIES.

It is <b>NOT</b> broken, as you may think by the previous posted warnings here, but it is a real `work in progress` and we don't want that others start using it as if it is stable and suddently their plugins stop working because we made some sort of incompatible modification on it.

You may use it but it is at your own risk. Don't ask us or blaim us if it doesn't fill your requests or if it brokens something on your production stage websites.

= THE CODE IS STILL VERY ALPHA-ish. DONT USE IT ON YOUR OWN PRODUCTION PLUGINS. Thanks! =


After issuing this <b>DISCLAIMER</b> we welcome any comments, ideias, testing, bug reporting and patches to make it better.

== Installation ==

How to install the Wordpress Plugin Framework Reloaded plugin and get it working in two easy steps:

1. Upload `/wordpress-plugin-framework-reloaded/` folder and its files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or just use the Wordpress admin interface
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Also, check out the other [Wordpress plugins](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/ipublicis) by the same author.

== Translations ==

If you want to make a translation for your language, use the framework-reloaded.pot included and (if you want) send me the files (just the .po and .mo ones) to dev@ipublicis.com for inclusion in plugin's package. You'll be credited, of course.

= Credits for present translations =

* Portuguese translation made by Lopo Lencastre de Almeida ([ipublicis](http://profiles.wordpress.org/ipublicis))
   	
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use it when developing your own plugin? =

The most minimal plugin made with WPFR is WPFR itself. Just check the code in the file `wordpress-plugin-framework-reloaded.php` to get an ideia on how you can have a gourgeous backoffice with almost nil effort.
A more complex project that you can check is [Author Box Reloaded](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/author-box-2/).

But, remember, this is very ALPHA-ish now. If we were you we would wait a little bit more before starting using it. We'll try not to break everything with future versions but we cannot promise that. 

Any help would be largely welcomed ;)

= Have more questions? =

Go to the [Wordpress' forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/wordpress-plugin-framework-reloaded?forum_id=10#postform).

== Screenshots ==

1. Global view of the new admin interface.
2. Can add your menu to a more proper section too.
3. Or create your own section if you wish (not advisable).
4. Using Wordpress Plugin Framework Reloaded turns access to help and other stuff much easier and makes admin interface more usable.
